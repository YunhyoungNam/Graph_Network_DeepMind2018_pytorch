# Graph Nets library

[Graph Nets](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets) is DeepMind's library for
building graph networks in Tensorflow and Sonnet.

#### What are graph networks?

A graph network takes a graph as input and returns a graph as output. The input
graph has edge- (*E* ), node- (*V* ), and global-level (**u**) attributes. The
output graph has the same structure, but updated attributes. Graph networks are
part of the broader family of "graph neural networks" (Scarselli et al., 2009).

To learn more about graph networks, see our arXiv paper: [Relational inductive
biases, deep learning, and graph networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261).
